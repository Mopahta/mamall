# STUN server

###### Session Traversal of UDP Protocol Through NAT

It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network address translator, and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application's User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts.

## Usage

```
npm i
node stun-server.js
```
Then you can make STUN request, and get IP and Port of your NAT device.
